Planned features:

- A HTML/Javascript widget to mine crypto (NIM) to any address that the user specifies.
- Dashboard to monitor earnings per site.
- Easy exchange of mined NIMs to Bitcoin/Ethereum/Monero via shapeshift, and perhaps to fiat currency as well.
- CAPTCHA that requires proof-of-work to proceed.
- Shortlinks that requires proof-of-work to proceed.
- Special hodler features: deposit crypto earning to a vesting account that cannot be withdrawn until a period of time has passed.
- Other ways to monetise your contents: proof-of-work protected blog posts, articles, etc.
