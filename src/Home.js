          <p>
            We provide a JavaScript miner that you can embed into your site.
            There is nothing to install. Your users loads a page containing our
            miner from their browser, and they mine for an ad-free experience or
            in exchange of contents on your site.

          <p>
            Below shows a demonstration of our miner.{' '}
            <strong>
              Click the toggle button on the top left corner and wait until
              consensus has been established
            </strong>. Mining begins when you see the message "Mining to ...".
            Here we set the miner to collect a total of 50K hashes and send the
            mining reward to the{' '}

              following wallet address
            </a>. The miner uses half of available CPU cores by default, but you
            can increase or decrease this by clicking the (+) button. Higher
            threads complete faster but use more CPU resources.

              of your coins in the Testnet may be reset at any time until the

            <CardText>
              Coinmiq provides a brand-new JavaScript miner that can be easily
              embedded in your website. Your users will mine Nimiq, a type of
              crypto-currency (<a href="#nimiq">explained here</a>) while they
              are browsing. By letting users pay you with their CPU power, our
              miner provides an excellent alternative to annoying ads.
            </CardText>
            <CardText>
              Our vision is to facilitate easy micro-transactions through the
              Web. By exchanging their computational power for mined
              crypto-currencies, users can now "pay" you with full privacy
              directly from their browser â€“ with a click of a button.
            </CardText>
            <CardText>
              Due to the nature of the blockchain technology that we use, mining
              is performed in a completely decentralised manner (there is no
              central server). At the moment, the miner only supports solo
              mining in the Testnet, but we will implement pooled mining when it
              is released in Q1 2018.{' '}
