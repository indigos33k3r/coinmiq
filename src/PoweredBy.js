                  1. The value of Nimiq is quite high, and it can be mined with
                  similar efficiency on high- and low-end hardwares due to its
                  memory-bound Proof-of-Work algorithm. This means a monster rig
                  with a top-end GPU will not outperform a mobile phone by a
                  factor of 10000x. From experience,{' '}
                  <strong>
                    we expect to see only up to 20x hashrate difference between
                    high- and low-end hardwares
                  </strong>. In contrast, mining non-ASIC cryptocurrencies (like
                  Bitcoin) with CPU makes no financial sense, even on a large
                  distributed scale.
